    //Demo 1

    //Declaring variables
    // var, let and const
    // With and without assignment
    // Do not use implicit declaration

    //implicit; DO NOT USE;

    //ECMAScript 5; explict; also undefined
    //a function-scoped variable whose declaration is hoisted and can lead to confusing code! 
    //To be avoided now that we have let and const

     //ECMAScript 6; block scope letiable; recommended



     //with assignment 


     // the same as let, but must be initialised at declaration and cannot be changed
     //UPPERCASE for constants


    //What should you use? const where possible. let when you need it to change





    //Demo 2 :  typeof operator




    
    //Demo3: Null is not undefined
    //Undefined is the value of an uninitialized letiable
    //null is an explicit keyword that tells the runtime it is ‘empty’
    //null is a value we can assign to represent objects that don’t exist




    //Demo4: The Boolean type
    //Boolean can hold two values – true and false
    // When evaluated against numbers, you can run into issues
    // false is evaluated as 0
    // true can be evaluated to 1
    // Vice-versa as well




    //Demo 5: The Number Type
    //let x1 = 34.00;
    //let x2 = 34;




    //Demo 6:  Examples of Number properties

    // const m = Number.MAX_VALUE;
    // console.log(m);

    // const n = Number.MIN_VALUE;
    // console.log(n);

    // const p = Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY;
    // console.log(p);

    // const ne = Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY;
    // console.log (ne);

    // let e = isNaN(124);  //NaN ;not a number
    // console.log(e);

    // let f = isNaN('Hello');
    // console.log(f);

    //Demo 7
    // let num = 5.56789;




    
    //Demo 8: The String Type
    // let busNmum = "Bus 321";  // Using double quotes
    // let busNmum = 'Bus 321';  // Using single quotes

    // let answer = "It's alright";             //Single quote inside double quote
    // let answer = "He is called 'Eddie'";    // Single quotes inside double quotes
    // let answer = 'He is called "Eddie"';    // Double quotes inside single quotes

    //Back-slash (\) used for escaping special characters
    // let y = "We are the so-called \"Vikings\" from the north."



    //Demo 9: String Concatenation and Interpolatio
    //Adding 2 (or more strings) is an expensive operation due to the memory manipulation required
    //To concatenate a string the + operator is used

    // let str1 = "5 + 3 = ";
    // let value = 5 + 3;
    // let str2 = str1 + value
                    // 5 + 3 = 8

    //Template literals (introduced in ES2015) allow for strings to be declared 
    //with JavaScript expressions that are evaluated immediately using ${} notation





    //Demo 10: String functions

     //let str = "hello world, welcome to the universe.";




    //returns the index of (the position of) 
    //the first occurrence of a specified text in a string




    //returns the character at a specified index (position) in a string:



 
 

    //The substring() method extracts the characters from a string, between two specified indices, 
    //and returns the new sub string.
    //This method extracts the characters in a string between "start" and "end", 
    //not including "end" itself
