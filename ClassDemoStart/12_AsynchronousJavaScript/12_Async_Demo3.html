         //   There’s a special syntax to work with promises in a more comfortable fashion, 
        // called “async/await”. It’s surprisingly easy to understand and use. 
        //It allows us to write asynchronous code in a synchronous manner
        //The word “async” before a function means one simple thing:
        // a function always returns a promise.
        //So, async ensures that the function returns a promise, and wraps non-promises in it. 
        //await allows us to wait for a Promise to resolve to a value.
        //await will return the value only after the Promise is resolved.

        Why Is It better?
        1) Concise and clean
        2) Error handling -- can use try/catch
        3) More readable with conditional statement as use less arrow function
        4)  Debugging - 
                You can’t set breakpoints in arrow functions that return expressions 
                (no body).
                With async/await you don’t need arrow functions as much, and you can 
                step through await calls exactly as if they were normal synchronous 
                calls.
        5) Error stacks -
                The error stack returned from a promise chain gives no clue of where 
                the error happened.
                However, the error stack from async/await points to the function 
                that contains the error
