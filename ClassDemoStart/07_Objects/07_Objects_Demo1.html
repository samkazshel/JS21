      //Objects in JavaScript are key – value pairs
      //Where standard arrays are index – value pairs
      //Keys are very useful for providing semantic data

      //   let student = new Object();
      //   student["name"] = "Ali";
      //   student["id"] = "1234";
      //   student["courseCode"] = "QAJVSC";
      //   student.email = "ali@qa.com"; // this notation is known as an expando property
      //   console.log(student);
      //   console.log(student["name"]);
      //   console.log(student.email);
      //objects do no have length properties, however they key part of a object is often reffered to as a property.

      // The object can have new properties added at any time
      // Known as an expando property

      //The key part of an object is often referred to as a property
      //it can be directly accessed

      //When working with objects, the for in loop is very useful
      // key holds the string value of the key
      // student is the object
      // So it loops for each property in the object

      //   for (let key in student) {
      //     console.log(`${key}: ${student[key]}`);
      //   } // for object, for in loop is the only way we can move through it.

      //Objects – literal notation
      //There is an alternative syntactic approach to defining objects

      let student2 = { name: "Lukas", id: "1234", courseCode: "QAJVSC" }; // last key value pair does not end with a comma
      console.log(student2);

      //This can be combined into more complex arrays
      //Below is an indexed array containing two object literals
      //Note the comma separator

      let classRoom = [
        { name: "Lukas", id: "1234", courseCode: "QAJVSC" },
        { name: "Daniel", id: "5678", courseCode: "QAJVSC" },
      ]; // this also known as a two dimensional array
      // which is a very popular data structure, JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)

      for (let i = 0; i < classRoom.length; i++) {
        for (let key in classRoom[i]) {
          console.log(key + " : " + classRoom[i][key]);
        }
      }
