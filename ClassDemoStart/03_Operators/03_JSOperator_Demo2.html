    //Demo 17: Strict equality operator
    //The strict equality operator differs from the equality operator, 
    //in that it pays strict attention to type as well as value when it assigns its Boolean. 
    
    // let a = true; 
    // let b = 1;





    //same as strict inequality operator
    //the two values are not only compared by their "implied" value 
    //(i.e. either or both values might get converted to make them comparable), 
    //but also by their original type.
